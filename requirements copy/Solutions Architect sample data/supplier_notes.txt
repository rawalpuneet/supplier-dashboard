================================================================================
QUICKFAB INDUSTRIES - CAUTION / HIGH RISK
================================================================================

Email from Cody (11/30/2021):
QuickFab delivered the heat exchanger order a week late. Quality was okay but the 
late delivery caused us to miss our customer deadline. Third time this has happened.

Email from Sarah (3/5/2022):
QuickFab was 4 weeks late on PO-2022-006. That's unacceptable. They quoted 3 weeks, 
delivered in 7 weeks. The brazing quality was also poor - 11 units leaked during 
pressure testing. Had to send back for rework which added another 2 weeks.

Meeting notes (5/12/2022):
Discussed QuickFab's repeated issues. Mike wants to keep using them because they're 
20-25% cheaper than other suppliers. Graham argued that quality issues cost more than 
we save. No decision made.

Email from Cody (5/8/2022):
QuickFab late again on the fin order (PO-2022-010). Fins were wrong thickness - 
completely unusable. 135 out of 950 parts rejected. They're offering to redo them 
but that's another 4 weeks. Customer is NOT happy.

Email from Sarah (8/20/2022):
Despite all the issues with QuickFab, they're still our most frequent supplier for 
aluminum work because of pricing. We need alternatives but nobody can match their quotes.

Email from Graham (3/8/2023):
Used QuickFab again for PO-2023-007 because Mike insisted on lowest cost. Predicted 
it would be late and have quality issues. I was right on both counts.

Cody's note (6/25/2023):
QuickFab's weld quality is consistently terrible. Every heat exchanger order has issues. 
We should really stop using them for pressure vessels. Brackets and fins are fine, 
but anything that needs structural integrity is a gamble.

Email from Mike (5/10/2024):
I know QuickFab has issues, but we're under pressure to cut costs. As long as they're 
30% cheaper, we'll keep using them and just plan for the delays and rework.

Sarah's email (9/30/2024):
QuickFab late AGAIN on PO-2024-021. That's the 8th late delivery this year out of 
9 orders. We need to seriously reconsider using them.

================================================================================
STELLAR METALWORKS - GOLD STANDARD
================================================================================

Email from Graham (11/8/2021):
Stellar Metalworks delivered early again. All 480 brackets were perfect - no burrs, 
no defects, excellent finish. This is why we pay premium for them.

Meeting notes (2/20/2022):
Stellar has never missed a delivery date in 3 years of working with them. Yes they're 
15-20% more expensive, but zero rework, zero delays, zero headaches. For critical 
customer deliveries, they're worth every penny.

Email from Cody (6/12/2022):
Stellar's quality is unmatched. Every part arrives deburred, finished, and perfectly 
packaged. They provide material certs and test reports without being asked. If only 
everyone could be like them.

Email from Sarah (3/15/2023):
Stellar quoted higher than QuickFab again. Mike questioned why we use them. I showed 
him QuickFab's rejection history - that ended the conversation. Went with Stellar.

Graham's note (7/20/2023):
Stellar is who I call when I absolutely cannot have problems. Customer delivery in 
2 weeks with zero margin for error? Stellar every time. Never regretted it.

Email from Cody (2/18/2024):
98 shafts from Stellar - zero defects. This is order #15 or #16 from them. Still 
waiting for the first rejection. They set the bar for what "good supplier" means.

Meeting notes (9/10/2024):
Why don't we use Stellar for everything? Answer: pricing and capacity. They're maxed 
out on motor shafts and can't take large orders. Also 20% premium pricing is hard to 
justify when Mike is cutting costs.

================================================================================
APEX MANUFACTURING / APEX MFG / APEX MFG INC / APEX MANUFACTURING INC
================================================================================

**NOTE: All four names are THE SAME COMPANY. Someone please fix this in SAP.**

Email from Sarah (10/20/2021):
Apex (on Industrial Drive) has been our default fan supplier for years. Solid B+ 
performance. Not amazing, not terrible. Pricing is fair, delivery is usually on time.

Meeting notes (4/12/2022):
Procurement meeting confusion: Sarah was talking about "APEX MFG" and Cody was 
referencing "Apex Manufacturing Inc" but they're the same company. This naming 
inconsistency makes it impossible to track their true performance across orders.

Email from Mike (1/25/2023):
Apex is reliable. They're our "default" when we don't have strong feelings either way. 
Fan motors, standard brackets, basic assemblies - Apex is fine for all of it.

Cody's note (8/15/2023):
Apex quality has been consistent over the years. 2-3% rejection rate which is 
acceptable. Delivery is 85-90% on time. Nothing spectacular but dependable.

Email from Graham (5/20/2024):
We probably give 40% of our fan business to Apex just because they're "who we use." 
Not sure if that's optimal but they've never had a major failure.

Sarah's email (9/15/2024):
Tried to run analytics on Apex performance but gave up because they appear under 4 
different names in our system. Someone needs to clean this up so we can actually 
see their full history.

================================================================================
TITANFORGE LLC - MOTORS ONLY, STAY IN YOUR LANE
================================================================================

Email from Cody (11/18/2021):
TitanForge is excellent for motors. Best in class for 3HP, 5HP, 7.5HP, and 10HP units. 
DO NOT use them for anything else - learned that the hard way.

Meeting notes (6/8/2022):
TitanForge tried to sell us on their new bearing line. I told them stick to motors, 
that's what you're good at. Mike gave them a trial order anyway. Prediction: regret.

Email from Graham (10/5/2022):
TitanForge motors: excellent. TitanForge bearings: mediocre. Let's stick with what works.

Email from Sarah (3/20/2023):
TitanForge's motor pricing is competitive and their lead times are accurate. When they 
say 5 weeks, it's 5 weeks. Reliable for motors, that's it.

Cody's note (8/10/2024):
TitanForge wanted to quote on control panels. I politely declined. They're a motor shop. 
Period.

================================================================================
AEROFLOW SYSTEMS - NICHE SPECIALIST (AIR HANDLING ONLY)
================================================================================

Email from Sarah (2/15/2022):
AeroFlow specializes in air handling components: dampers, louvers, filters. Premium 
pricing but excellent quality. Don't bother asking them to quote motors or heat 
exchangers - not their expertise.

Meeting notes (7/22/2022):
AeroFlow's lead times are the most accurate in our supplier base. If they say 3 weeks, 
it's exactly 3 weeks. Never had a surprise delivery. Worth the premium for project 
planning reliability.

Email from Cody (12/5/2022):
AeroFlow's HEPA filters are certified for cleanroom environments. When we have data 
center customers with strict air quality specs, they're the only supplier we trust.

Graham's note (6/15/2023):
AeroFlow knows their niche and stays in it. Respect that. Don't ask them to be something 
they're not.

Email from Sarah (4/10/2024):
AeroFlow raised prices 8% this year but their quality and delivery are still flawless. 
Customers don't complain about AeroFlow parts - that's worth the premium.

================================================================================
PRECISION THERMAL CO - ELECTRONICS & CONTROLS EXPERT
================================================================================

Email from Graham (1/28/2022):
Precision Thermal is our go-to for anything electronic. Temperature controllers, sensors, 
PLC modules, VFDs. They actually understand control systems engineering, unlike the 
fabrication shops who just quote on everything.

Meeting notes (5/15/2022):
Precision Thermal helped us debug a sensor integration issue even though it wasn't 
related to their parts. Excellent technical support. This is why we pay slightly more.

Email from Cody (9/20/2022):
If it has a circuit board or needs calibration, buy it from Precision Thermal. If it's 
sheet metal, buy it elsewhere. They know their lane.

Email from Sarah (2/10/2023):
Precision Thermal's pricing is fair and transparent. Never had surprise charges or 
delivery issues. Solid technical partner.

Graham's note (7/18/2024):
Precision Thermal is one of our most reliable suppliers. They understand data center 
requirements and electrical specs. Trust them completely for control components.

================================================================================
GENERAL PROCUREMENT ISSUES
================================================================================

Email from Mike (7/25/2023):
We need to get smarter about supplier selection. I keep hearing "we used them before 
and they had problems" AFTER we've already placed an order. This is costing us real money.

Sarah's email (10/15/2023):
I send out monthly supplier performance reports but I don't think anyone actually reads 
them. The data is all there but it's just Excel spreadsheets. People need something more 
actionable - a dashboard or search tool or something.

Meeting notes (3/20/2024):
Discussed supplier consolidation strategy. We have 40+ active suppliers but probably 
only need 15-20. Problem: we don't have good data on who's actually performing vs. 
who we keep using out of habit.

Cody's note (6/15/2024):
Data center buildout boom is killing us. Orders are up 3x compared to last year but 
our supplier base hasn't scaled to match. We're using suppliers we barely know because 
our good ones (Stellar, Precision) are at capacity. Recipe for disaster.

Email from Graham (8/20/2024):
QuickFab just delivered another bad batch. That's the 6th quality issue this year. 
Why do we keep using them? Because Mike looks at price first. We need data that shows 
the TOTAL cost including rework, delays, and customer complaints.

Sarah's email (9/28/2024):
Tried to calculate "total cost of ownership" for suppliers but gave up. Too many 
variables, data is scattered across 3 systems and email. We need this automated somehow.

Meeting notes (10/10/2024):
Major customer (CoreWeave data center) threatening to switch suppliers because of our 
delivery inconsistency. This is a $12M annual account. Root cause: we keep using 
unreliable suppliers because we don't have good performance data at decision time.

Mike's urgent email (10/12/2024):
We have a $2M sourcing decision coming up in 3 weeks for new data center project. 
Need to make this decision based on actual data, not gut feel. This is exactly the 
type of situation where better supplier intelligence would save us.
